# vocabulary.com-scraper
This is a small python script that scrapes words lists from vocabulary.com and outputs the list to your command line.

## How to use the script
This script takes a single command line argument, the argument will be the link to your list on vocabulary.com.
* Make sure you have python installed
* open your command line of choice
* enter ```python vocab_scrape.py <link to vocabulary.com vocab list>```

### How I used the script to output the list of words to a text file on my desktop
```
python vocab_scrape.py https://www.vocabulary.com/lists/98722 > ~/Desktop/words.txt
```
